      <h1>Why Music is Important</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Music is a way of expression, it gives people a way to express who they are inside in many diffrent forms. 
                Music has many benefits weather it's emotionally, socially, and Psyschologically. </h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">When we listen to music we are using our whole entire brain. Scientists are still trying to figure out how exactly music effects us as much as it does, but what they do know is that music has a very beneficial effect on the brain. One of the biggest effects music has on our brain is health benefit. Daniel Levitin, is a 
                psychologist at McGill University in Montreal, who studies the neuroscience of music. Levinitin along with associates put together three experiments to help figure out what exactly is going on in our brain when we listen to our music. Levintin published a 400 study meta- analysis. One study was done with people that were about to have surgery done. 
                As one would think, people are very anxious before getting surgery. One group listened to music before going in and the other was given drugs to help calm them. The studies showed that the people who listened to music were actually the group there were calmer before going into the room for surgery. This is great because music is much cheaper then drugs. 
                Not only does music help with anxiety it also helps with pain. Studies show that since it helps relax people it is great for people who are giving birth or can even be given for anesthesia while in the room getting the surgery preformed. Another reason for this is became music releases endorphins, which makes people happy. These endorphins help counter act 
                and distract people from the pain.</p>

      <h1>Benifits Of Playing An Insturment</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Music increasecs the capacity of your memory, Refines time management and organizational skills, and boots your team skills.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Science has shown that musical training can change brain structure and function for the better. It can also improve long-term memory and lead to better brain development for those who start at a young age. Furthermore, musicians tend to be more mentally alert. Unlike brain-games, playing an instrument is a rich and complex experience. This is because it's integrating information from senses like vision, hearing, and touch, along with fine movements. This can result long-lasting changes in the brain. This can also be applicable in the business world.</p>
